THE TESTSTES
============
1. I am using PHPUnit to run the tests  
2. I am using the explicit include (including explicitly all the files) and not an auto loader
3. The tests (currently) as to test the Reques staructure generated. Hence use only the *_dry functions.
   there is an **Examples** section where you can use your own credentials and test it on your own surveys.
